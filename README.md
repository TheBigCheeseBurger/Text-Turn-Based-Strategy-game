## How to play

Simply run [main.py](main.py) using an IDE of your choice, that is all that must be done.
It does not require any modules that don't come with Python when you install it\*.
I wouldn't recommend straight running the file by double clicking it as that would just open a command prompt that'll close itself, without any logging,
if the programme
abruptly stops running (which it will if you die for whatever reason).

\**If, for whatever reason, think you may be missing those modules, they are **time** and **json**
(Though I would not worry as these come preinstalled when you download Python for the first time).*

## Statement of Intent

This programme was made as a passion project of mine because I wanted to put my Python skills to the limit, and learn something new while having fun along the way.
There were times where I smiled, times where I laughed, and times where I wanted to pull my hair out.
Core gameplay has been inspired by Fallout 1 and 2.

## Special thanks

Tim Cain, Chris Avellone, and everyone else at Interplay Entertainment and Black Isle Studios for Fallout, as that was the primary inspiration for this game,
from the combat to some of the story, too. Furthermore, Wizards of the Coast for Dungeons and Dragons, of which some of the light RPG elements are inspired by.
